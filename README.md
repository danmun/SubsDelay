# SubsDelay
Subtitle delayer program.<br />

The better media players have a much more complex subtitle modifying function already built in so use that if playing media on a computer.<br />
<br />
This simple tool could be useful if you want to stream your media over devices that don't support on-the-go subtitle modification.<br />
